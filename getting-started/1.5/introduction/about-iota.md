# IOTA

**IOTA is an open source, feeless, and scalable distributed ledger technology, designed to support frictionless data and value transfer.**

## Why use IOTA

As a distributed ledger technology, IOTA provides a trust layer for any devices that are connected to the global Internet.

Through its open network of nodes, IOTA allows you and your devices to:

- Use the network as a source of truth for data
- Transfer value in IOTA tokens
- Simply and seamlessly manage your tokens

## Who is IOTA for

IOTA can benefit many people, including the following important groups:

### Anyone who does not trust centralized networks

IOTA networks are peer-to-peer networks where no central authority controls the data. Instead, all nodes hold a copy of it and reach a consensus on its contents.

### Anyone who wants to secure their data

Everything in the Tangle is immutable and transparent. Through cryptography, you can prove that data has not changed.

### Anyone who values security

IOTA uses multiple, secure signatures to protect the network against the next generation of computing power.

### Anyone who wants the freedom to transact

IOTA is free to use. You don't need to pay a subscription, sign a contract, or have any form of official identification. Even transactions are feeless.
